                <div class="content-text">
                    Raised by two self-made, small-business-owning parents it’s not too surprising why I was printing and selling comic books for a profit in third grade or selling all the books I had already read in a makeshift book store in the back of my mom’s vet clinic when I was 8. I’m an entrepreneur at heart and am always looking for opportunities to fail miserably. Because as every good entrepreneur knows, failure is the first step to success.

                <div class="content-sub">An Art Director</div>
                <div class="content-text">My two hard-working, loving parents dished out a pretty penny for my private business school education and it was all going to pay off with a plush financial career until I found a new calling while studying abroad in the financial capital of the world, London.  A curious series about some 1960’s ad men soundly and swiftly derailed my dreams of investment banking. Mad Men revealed an avenue where my creativity and business acumen could coexist. I picked up photoshop, read straight through the <a class="link-lb" href="#">“Do It Yourself Lobotomy”</a> and secured a dismally low-paying creative internship as quickly as I could. Now I work from concept to execution on various projects involving brands like Butterfinger, Hot Pockets, Lean Pockets, Nestea, Jarritos, Caress, LinkedIn, IZZE and others.</div>
                
                <div class="content-sub">A FOOD EATER</div>
                <div class="content-text">I love food. I love eating it, making it, tasting it, smelling it. I’ve made reservations 2 months in advance for it.  I’ve waited in a parking lot for 3 hours for it. I’ve given up a week’s paycheck for a meal-worth of it.  I’ve dressed up in a tux fancier than my prom outfit so I could satisfy the dress code to be in the same room with it. I simply love food. My favorites? I love me some <a class="link-lb" href="#">southern BBQ</a>, <a class="link-lb" href="#">Shabu Shabu</a>, or well-crafted <a class="link-lb" href="#">bánh mì</a>. Or if you want to get serious, nothing beats the <a class="link-lb" href="#">bastilla at Tagine.</a></div>
